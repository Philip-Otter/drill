# Drill
Drill is a short script that I wrote for enumerating through a list of domain names output by nnoS.py

I wrote drill to help during the zone transfer section of the HTB CBBH training.

To use drill:
1. Run nnoS.py 
2. Edit the marked section in drills code to reflect the nnoS.py output file path
3. Run the script
4. Profit
